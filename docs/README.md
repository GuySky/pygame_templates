# Pygame Templates Collection

This repo contains various templates for creating a game using [Pygame(-ce)][pygame-ce] library.   
The repository free to use and doesn't require Trademark as it is distributed under the [MIT license][license].   
You can and may copy whole or parts of it into your project with no limitations.   
However, its author personally recommends you to write the code yourself, because it will provide you with unique expirience.
